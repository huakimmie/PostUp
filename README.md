# PostUp
Post Up is an online forum, loosely modeled after Reddit. It has functionalities such as unique users, posts, and comments. The views were designed using traditional front end technologies; HTML, CSS, and JS. On the back end, SQLite3 and PHP were used for all server-side functionality, heavily relying on AJAX for the in-between. Furthermore, session tracking and remembering is done utilizing PHP/JS cookies.
